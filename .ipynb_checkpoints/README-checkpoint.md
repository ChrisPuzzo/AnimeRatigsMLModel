# project-1. Individual Implementation Project


This project reads through a datbase from a popular anime rating website and trys to predict what the rating will be based on the other data provided. The code first reads in the database and transforms it to a dataframe. From their it goes through the datafram looking for any nonexisting or null data, and it will remove that row.
